# Having fun with AI 

# Prerequisites 
 
* a github account for saving  work.
* Anaconda 3 installed and configured
* A python code editor. PyCharm and VisualCode both are quite good and free.
* OpenAI SDK account


## Setting up Github 
Each kid will need a github account for saving their work. Make sure the kid knows 
how to check in and checkout from github. You should make sure that they can do the following 
* Create a new repository. Keep the repository private to start with.
* Check out contents of the repository locally.
* Make a small change to a file, then commit the changes
* Push the changes to the repository and confirm that the changes are visible 
    in github (online)
    

## Anaconda 
If the laptop/computer does not already have Anaconda, 
[download it](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)  and install 
in ```$HOME/Anaconda3``` folder. For Windows, ```$HOME``` folder typically looks 
like  ```C:\Users\<user name>```. Make sure you can start Anaconda command line 
prompt. Anaconda installation instructions are also available on [anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

After installing Anaconda, start Anaconda command prompt and make sure you can start 
python interpreter. Exit the interpreter  and then, from the same Anaconda command prompt , 
start jupyter lab by typing 
```jupyter lab```. This should start Jupyter lab notebook server and open the notebook in a 
web browser. Make sure that the Jupyter lab notebook works. 

## Python code editor 
Install one of the following code editors 
* [PyCharm community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) 
* [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 

I recommend PyCharm but VisualCode works just as well if your kid knows how to use it (I do not use 
it so I won't be able to help). 

## OpenAI account 
[Sign-up for OpenAI SDK](https://platform.openai.com/signup). You may need to add a credit card. 
Make sure you 
configure your account with a small limit. This is in case kids accidentally leak the API key 
or do something silly (like making an expensive API call in an infite loop). You should be able 
to create multiple keys or kids can simply share keys. So you need only one account which can be controlled
by the parent. 

After creating an account, you may need to create a separate request to get access to GPT-4.
