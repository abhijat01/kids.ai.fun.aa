# Having fun with AI 

# Prerequisites 
 
* A GitHub account for saving work
* Anaconda 3 installed and configured
* A Python code editor (either PyCharm or Visual Studio Code)
* OpenAI SDK account


## Setting up Github 
Each child will need a GitHub account to save their work. Ensure they know how to check in 
and check out from GitHub. Make sure they perform the following steps at least once:

* Create a new repository (keep it private initially)
* Clone the repository locally
* Make a small change to a file, commit the changes
* Push the changes to the repository and verify that the changes are visible on GitHub (online)
    

## Anaconda 
If the laptop/computer does not already have Anaconda, 
[download it](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)  and install 
in ```$HOME/Anaconda3``` folder. For Windows, ```$HOME``` folder typically looks 
like  ```C:\Users\<user name>```. Ensure that you can start Anaconda command line 
prompt. You can find Anaconda installation instructions 
on the  [Anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

After installing Anaconda, open the Anaconda command prompt and ensure you 
can start the Python interpreter. Exit the interpreter, and then, from the same 
Anaconda command prompt, start Jupyter Lab by typing:

    jupyter lab 

This command will start the Jupyter Lab notebook server and open the notebook in a web browser. 
Ensure that the Jupyter Lab notebook works.

## Python code editor 
Install one of the following code editors 
* [PyCharm community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) 
* [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 

I recommend PyCharm but VisualCode works just as well if your child  knows how to use it (I do not use 
it so I won't be able to provide assistance during our sessions). 

## OpenAI account 
[Sign-up for OpenAI SDK](https://platform.openai.com/signup). You will  need to add a credit card. 
Ensure that you  configure your account with a small limit. After  creating your account, go to 
```Manage Account  -->Billing --> Usage limits``` and  setup soft  and hard  limits a small amount. 
Children  will typically use up a  dollar or two worth of compute a day so a $30 soft and $40 hard limit 
should be  safe.  You can create  multiple keys or children  can  share keys. You need only 
one account which should  controlled  by the parent.  Make sure you create the API key and save it 
somewhere on the laptop that your child will use. 

After creating an account, you may need to submit  a separate request to gain  access to GPT-4.
